The United\\nNations is actively mediating crises before they explode\\ninto war, all around the world. And today more people\\ndetermine their own destiny than at any previous moment\\nin history.\\nWe celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights with those rights more\\nwidely embraced than ever before. On every continent\\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\\nNations.\\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\\ndetermined to do that.\\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\\nStates to acquire such weapons.\\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of\\nperson.\\u201d\\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\\nto building bridges between nations \\u2014 people very much\\nlike all of those present \\u2014 died in a campaign of hatred\\nagainst the United States.\\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\\nelsewhere.\\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\\nto pull back from the world\\u2019s trouble spots, to turn our\\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\\na victory they must never have.\\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\\nmore injured \\u2014 innocent people going about their business\\non a busy morning.\\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\\nalike \\u2014 mostly children and women, two of them\\npregnant \\u2014 people out shopping together when their\\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\\npast.\\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\\nAires.\\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\\nPresident to assassination.\\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\\nNone of those victims were American. But every\\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\\nmother \\u2014 a human life extinguished by someone else\\u2019s\\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\\nbe the same.\\nTerror has become the world\\u2019s problem. Some argue,\\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\\nthreat to all humankind.\\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\\n10\\n\\n\\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\\nEast, in Asia, in South America \\u2014 how many agreements\\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\\nlost in their aftermath.\\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\\nafter all, a leap of faith \\u2014 a break with the past \\u2014 and\\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\\nis not a social programme.\\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\\nbetween the world\\u2019s haves and have-nots. We must work\\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\\nthe poison of hatred.\\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world\\u2019s\\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\\nwithin them.\\nSome believe that terrorism\\u2019s principal fault line\\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\\nhave \\u2014 even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\\nof Islam.\\nA quarter of the world\\u2019s population is Muslim, from\\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\\n11\\n\\n\\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: \\u201cRewards for\\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\\nprayers said at home.\\u201d\\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\\nshould be at the top of the world\\u2019s agenda, what, then, are\\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\\ndespair.\\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\\nNations Children\\u2019s Fund, the World Bank and the World\\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\\ncommunity.\\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\\nthat we do this together.\\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\\njust beginning,\\n\\u201cAll agreements and all peace are built on\\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\\nget on with other people in the world unless you\\nhave confidence in them.\\u201d\\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world\\u2019s\\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\\nnecessary that we agree on all the world\\u2019s issues to have\\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\\nwith confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"53\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1998\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "'A short walk from this Hall is the delegates\\' Meditation Room, a refuge from a world deafened by the noise of strife and violence. \"We want to bring back the idea of worship\", Dag Haramarskjold once said about this room, \"devotion to something which is greater and higher than we are ourselves\".\\nIt is just such devotion that gave birth to the United Nations: devotion to the dream of world peace and freedom, of human rights and democratic self-determination, of a time when, in those ancient words, \"... they shall beat their swords into plowshares ... nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more\".\\nThe United States remains committed to the United Nations. For over 40 years, this Organization has provided an international forum for harmonizing conflicting national interests and has made a significant contribution in such fields as peace-keeping, humanitarian assistance, and eradicating disease. Yet, no one knows better than those in this Hall how the noble ideals embodied in the Charter have often remained unfulfilled. This Organization itself faces a critical hour - that\\nis usually stated as a fiscal crisis. But we can turn this \"crisis\" into an opportunity. The important reforms proposed by the Group of Experts can be a first step towards restoring this Organization\\'s status and effectiveness. The issue, ultimately, is not one of cash but of credibility. If all the Members of this universal Organization decide to seize the moment and turn the rhetoric of reform into reality, the future of the United Nations will be secure. And members have my word for it: My country, which has always given the United Nations generous support, will continue to play a leading role in the effort to achieve its noble purposes.\\nWhen I came before the Assembly last year, an important moment in the pursuit of those purposes had not yet occurred. The leaders of the Soviet Union and the United States were to meet in Geneva. These discussions have now been held. For over 15 hours, the Soviet and American delegations met. For about five hours, General Secretary Gorbachev and I talked alone.\\nOur talks were frank. The talks were also productive - in a larger sense than even the documents that were agreed. Mr. Gorbachev was blunt; so was I. We came to realize again the truth of the statement: Nations do not mistrust each other because they are armed; they are armed because they mistrust each other. And I did not hesitate to tell Mr. Gorbachev our view of the source of that mistrust: the Soviet Union\\'s record of seeking to impose its ideology and rule on others. So we acknowledged the deep and abiding differences between our systems of government, our views of history, and the future of mankind. But, despite these differences, we resolved to work together for real reductions in nuclear arms, as well as progress in other areas.\\nDelegates to the forty-first session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, today I want to report to you on what has transpired since the summit, notably the important letter X sent on 25 July to Mr. Gorbachev. In that letter, I dealt with the important issues of reducing nuclear arms, agreeing on strategic defenses, and limiting nuclear testing. In addition to those issues, which concern the military aspects of Soviet-American relations, I would also like to address other essential steps towards peace: the resolution of political conflicts, the strengthening of the international economy, and the protection of human rights.\\nBefore I do this, however, let me, in the tradition of candor established at Geneva, tell you that a pall has been cast over our relations with the Soviet Union. I refer here to a particularly disturbing example of Soviet transgressions against human rights.\\nRecently - after the arrest of a Soviet national and united Nations employee accused of espionage in the United States - an American correspondent in Moscow was made the subject of fabricated accusations and trumped-up charges. He was arrested and jailed in a callous disregard of due process and numerous human rights conventions. In effect, he was taken as a hostage - even threatened with the death penalty.\\nBoth individuals have now been remanded to their respective ambassadors. But this is only an interim step, agreed to by the United States for humanitarian reasons, it does not change the facts of the case: Gennadi Zakharov is an accused spy who should stand trial; Nicholas Daniloff is an innocent hostage who should be released. The Soviet Union bears the responsibility for the consequences of its action. Misusing the United Nations for the purposes of espionage does a grave disservice to this Organization.\\nThe world expects better. It expects contributions to the cause of peace that only the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union can make.\\nIt is for this reason that I wrote last summer to Mr. Gorbachev with new arms control proposals. Before discussing the proposals, let us be clear about which weapons are the most dangerous and threatening to peace. The threat does not come from defensive systems, which are a shield against attack, but from offensive weapons - ballistic missiles that hurtle through space and can wreak mass destruction on the surface of the Earth - especially the Soviet Union\\'s heavy, accurate ICBMs, with multiple warheads, which have no counterparts in size or number in any other country.\\nThat is why the United States has long urged radical, equitable, verifiable reductions in these offensive systems. Note that I said reduction; for this is the real purpose of arms control: not just to codify the levels of today\\'s arsenals, not just to channel their further expansion, but to reduce them in ways that will reduce the danger of war. Indeed, the United States believes the prospect of a future without such weapons cf mass destruction must be the ultimate goal of arms control.\\nI am pleased to say that the Soviet Union has now embraced our idea of radical reductions in offensive systems. At the Geneva summit last November, we agreed to intensify work in this area. Since then, the Soviets have made detailed proposals which, while not acceptable to us, appear to represent a serious effort. So we continue to seek a 50 per cent reduction of American and Soviet arsenals - with the central focus on the reduction of ballistic missile warheads. If the Soviet Union wants only a lesser reduction, however, we are prepared to consider it but as an interim measure. In other provisions as well, we have sought to take account of Soviet concerns. So there has been movement.\\nSimilarly, in the area of intermediate-range nuclear forces, the United States seeks the total elimination of such missiles on a global basis. Again, if the Soviet Union insists on pursuing such a goal in stages, we are prepared to conclude an interim agreement without delay.\\nAll this gives me hope. I can tell representatives that the exchanges between our two sides this summer could well have marked the beginning of serious, productive negotiation on arms reductions. The ice of the negotiating stalemate could break, if both sides intensify their effort in the new round of Geneva talks and if we keep the promises we made to each other last November.\\nFor too long a time, however, the Soviet response has been to downplay the need for offensive reductions. When the United States began work technology to make offensive nuclear weapons obsolete some day, the Soviets tried to make that the main issue - as if the main danger to strategic stability was a defense against missiles that is still on the drawing boards, rather than the menacing ballistic missiles themselves that already exist in excessive numbers.\\nStill, the United States recognizes that both the offensive and defensive sides of the strategic equation must be addressed. And we have gone far to meet Soviet concerns expressed about the potential offensive use of strategic defensive systems. I have offered firm and concrete assurances that our strategic defense initiative could never be used to deploy weapons in space that can cause mass destruction on earth. I have pointed out that the radical reduction we seek now in offensive arsenals would be additional insurance that strategic defense initiative cannot be used to support a first-strike strategy. Our preference from the beginning has been to move forward co-operatively with the Soviets on strategic defenses, so that neither side will feel threatened and both can benefit from the strategic revolution that strategic defense initiative represents.\\nThe United States continues to respect the anti-ballistic missile Treaty - in spite of clear evidence that the Soviets are violating it. We have told the Soviets that, if we can both agree on radical reductions in strategic offensive weapons, we are prepared right now to sign ah agreement with them on research, development, testing and deployment of strategic defenses based on the following.\\nFirst, both sides would agree to confine themselves, through 1991, to research, development and testing, which are permitted by the anti-ballistic missile Treaty, to determine whether advanced systems of strategic defense are technically feasible.\\nSecondly, a new treaty, signed now, would provide that, if after 1991 either side should decide to deploy such a system, that side would be obliged to offer a plan for sharing the benefits of strategic defense and eliminating offensive ballistic missiles. This plan would be negotiated over a two-year period.\\nThirdly, if the two sides cannot agree after two years of negotiation, either side would be free to deploy an advanced strategic defensive system, after giving six months* notice to the other.\\nAs the United States has repeatedly made clear, we are moving towards a future of greater reliance upon strategic defense. The United States remains prepared to talk about how - under what ground rules and process - we and the Soviet Union can do this co-operatively. Such strategic defenses, coupled with radical reductions in offensive forces, would represent a safer balance and give future statesmen the opportunity to move beyond it - to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.\\nIn addition to our proposals on offensive reductions and strategic defense, we have suggested new steps in another area - nuclear testing. Just as eliminating all nuclear weapons is our long-term goal, so too is a total ban on nuclear\\ntesting; but both must be approached with practical steps. For the reality is that for now we still must rely on these weapons for the deterrence of war; thus the safety and reliability of our deterrent are themselves critical to peace.\\nThe United States is proud of its record of nuclear safety and intends to maintain it. Nevertheless, we are as I said, ready now to take two important steps towards limiting nuclear testing: first, we ace ready to move forward on ratification of the Threshold Test Ban Treaty and the Treaty on Peaceful Nuclear Explosions, once agreement is reached on improved verification procedures. We have proposed new ideas to make this possible; secondly, upon ratification of those treaties - and in association with a program to reduce and ultimately eliminate all nuclear weapons - we are prepared to discuss ways to implement a step-by-step parallel program of limiting and ultimately ending nuclear testing.\\nThose are steps that we could take in the near future to show the world that we are moving forward. I therefore call upon the Soviet Union to join us in practical, attainable progress in limiting nuclear testing.\\nJust a few days ago I received a reply from General Secretary Gorbachev to my letter of 25 July - and, for the moment, let me say simply that we are giving it\\nAs we move towards our goal of eliminating nuclear weapons, it is vital that we also address important imbalances in other kinds of weapons. This is why the United States has proposed a comprehensive global ban on all chemical weapons and why we and our allies have tried hard to break the stalemate in the conventional force negotiations in Vienna. In the Stockholm Conference a major advance has been achieved: a concrete new set of military confidence-building measures which\\nBut we must remember from the experience of the 1970s that progress in arms control cannot be divorced from regional political developments. As I said at the beginning, political tensions cause military competition, not the other way around.\\nHowever, while the United States and the Soviet Union disagree over the root causes of political tension, we agree that regional conflicts could escalate into global confrontation. Last year, from this rostrum, I presented a formula for peace which would apply to five critical regional conflicts that are potential flash points for wider conflicts. I pointed out how difficult it is for the United States to accept Soviet assurances of peaceful intent when 126,000 Soviet troops prosecute a vicious war against the Afghan people; when 140,000 Soviet-backed Vietnamese soldiers wage war on the people of Cambodia; when 1,700 Soviet advisers and 2,500 Cuban combat troops are involved in military planning and operations in Ethiopia; when 1,300 Soviet military advisers and 36,000 Cuban troops direct and participate in combat operations to prop up an unpopular, repressive regime in Angola; when hundreds of millions of dollars in Soviet arms and Soviet-bloc advisers help a dictatorial regime in Nicaragua try to subvert and betray a popular revolution.\\nThe danger inherent in these conflicts must be recognized. Marxist-Leninist regimes tend to wage war as readily against their neighbors as they routinely do against their own people. In fact, the internal and external wars often become indistinguishable. In Afghanistan, for example, the puppet regime has announced its intention to relocate tens of thousands of people from border areas, Can anyone doubt this will be done in classic communist style - by force? Many will die, to make it easier for the Soviets and their satellite troops to intimidate Pakistan.\\nIt is just such transgressions that make the risk o£ confrontation with democratic nations so acute. So, once again, I propose a three-point peace process for the resolution of regional conflicts: first, talks between the warring parties themselves, without which an end to violence and national reconciliation are impossible; secondly, discussions between the united States and the Soviet Union - not to impose solutions but to support peace talks and eventually eliminate the supply of arms ^and the proxy troops from abroad; thirdly, if the talks are successful, joint efforts to welcome each country back into the world economy and the community of nations that respect human rights.\\nIn addition to regional disputes, the grave threat of terrorism also jeopardizes the hopes for peace. No cause, no grievance can justify it. Terrorism is heinous and intolerable. It is the crime of cowards - cowards who prey on the innocent, the defenseless, and the helpless.\\nWith its allies and other nations, the United States has taken steps to counter terrorism directly - particularly State-sponsored terrorism. Last April, the United States demonstrated that it will defend its interests and act against terrorist aggression. Let me assure all of you today, especially let me assure any potential sponsors of terrorism, that the American people are of one mind on this issue. Like other civilized peoples of the world, we have reached our limit. Attacks against our citizens or our interests will not go unanswered.\\nWe will also do all in our power to help other law-abiding nations threatened by terrorist attacks. To that end, the United States believes that the understandings reached by the seven industrial democracies at the Tokyo summit last May made a good start towards international accord in the war on terrorism. We recommend to the General Assembly consideration of the Tokyo resolutions.\\nMoving to the economic realm, how ironic it is that some continue to espouse such ideus as a \"new international economic order\" based on State control when the world is learning, as never before, that the freedom of the individual, not the power of the State, is the key to economic dynamism and growth. Nations have turned away from centralized management and government controls and towards the incentives and rewards of the free market. They have invited their citizens\\'to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest and, in the process, to provide jobs, to create wealth, to build social stability and foster faith in the future for all. The economic summits of the industrial democracies have paid a tribute to these principles - as has the historic United Nations special session on Africa in\\nHay. We applaud the African nations\\' call for reform leading to greater reliance on their private sectors for economic growth. We believe that overcoming hunger and economic stagnation requires policies that encourage Africa\\'s own productivity and initiative; such a policy framework will make it easier for the rest of the world, including the United States, to help. The laws of economic incentives do not discriminate between developed and developing countries. They apply to all equally.\\nMuch of the recent recovery in the world economy can be directly attributed to this growth of economic freedom. And it is this trend that offers such hope for the future. And yet this new hope faces a grave threat: the menace of trade barriers. History shows that the imposition of such barriers invites retaliation, which in turn sparks the very sort of trade wars that plunged the world in the 1930s deeper into depression and economic misery. Truly, protectionism is destructionism.\\nThat is why the United States seeks the assistance of all countries represented here in the General Assembly in protecting the practice of free and fair trade. We applaud the success of the meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) trade ministers last week in Uruguay, where agreement was reached to launch a new round of multilateral trade negotiations covering a wide range of topics important to economic growth, with over 90 other countries members of GATT, the United States is working to maintain the free flow of international trade.\\nIn addition to resistance to protectionism, the United States is also seeking to stimulate world economic growth in other ways. Our Treasury bill interest rate is now just over 5 per cent, the lowest it has been in nine years - which provides enormous relief to debtor countries. America\\'s new tax structure will open the way for greater prosperity at home, which will contribute to greater prosperity abroad.\\nFinally, the united States is working with other countries to minimize currency swings, to promote stability in the monetary markets, to establish predictability as a basis for prosperity.\\nBut, the United States believes the greatest contribution we can make to world prosperity is the continued advocacy of the magic of the market-place - the truth, the simple and proven truth, that economic development is an outgrowth of economic freedom just as economic freedom is the inseparable twin of political freedom and democratic government.\\nAnd it is here that we come to our final category - human rights - the indispensable element for peace, freedom, and prosperity. I note that Mr. Gorbachev has used in recent speeches the same categories I have used here todays the military, the political, and the economic; except that he titled his fourth category: humanitarian.\\nThe difference is revealing. The United States believes that respect for the individual, for the dignity of the human person - those rights outlined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Hunt i Rights - does not belong in the realm of charity or \"humanitarian\" causes. Respect for human rights is not social work; it is not merely an act of compassion, it is the first obligation of government and the source of its legitimacy.\\nIt also is the foundation-stone in any structure of world peace. All through history, it has been the dictatorships and the tyrannies that have surrendered first to the cult of militarism and the pursuit of war. Countries based on the consent of the governed, countries that recognize the inalienable rights of the individual, do not make war on each other. Peace is more than just an absence of war. True peace is justice, true peace is freedom. And true peace dictates the recognition of human rights.\\nCommitments were made more than 10 years ago in Helsinki concerning those rights and their recognition. We need only look to the East today to see how sadly unfulfilled those commitments are. The persecution of scientists, religious leaders, peace activists, political dissenters, and other prisoners of conscience continues unabated behind the Iron Curtain. You know, one section of the Helsinki Accords even speaks to: \"improvement of working conditions of journalists\".\\nSo, it is clear that progress in the human rights area must keep pace with progress in other areas. A failure on this score will hinder further movement in East-West relations.\\nThese, then, are the areas of concern and of opportunity that the United States sees in the quest for peace and freedom - the twin objectives of the United Nations Charter.\\nLast year, I pointed out in my address to the General Assembly the differences between the United States and the Soviet Union are deep and abiding. But I also called for a fresh start in relations between our two nations, a fresh start that could benefit our own people and the people of every nation. Since that time, the United States has taken action and put forth new proposals that could lead our two countries and the entire world in a direction we all have long sought to go. Now more than ever, it is the responsibility of the Soviet Union to take action and demonstrate that they too are continuing the dialog for peace.\\nAs I have said, I believe that we can be hopeful about the world and the prospects for freedom. We only need look around us to see the new technologies that may some day spare future generations the nightmare of nuclear terror, or the growing ranks of democratic activists and freedom fighters, or the increasing movement towards free market economies, or the extent of world-wide concern about the rights of the individual in the face of brute, State power.\\nIn the past, when I have noted such trends - when I have called for a \"forward strategy for freedom\" and predicted the ultimate triumph of democratic rule over totalitarianism - some have accused me of telling people what they want to hear, of urging them not: to engage the day but to escape it.\\nYet, to hope is to believe in humanity; and in its future. Hope remains the highest reality, the age-old power; hope is at the root of all the great ideas and causes that have bettered the lot of humankind across the centuries.\\nHistory teaches us to hope - for it teaches us about man, and about the irrepressible human spirit, A Nobel laureate in literature, a great figure of the American South, William Faulkner, once said that the last sound heard on earth would be that of the two remaining humans arguing over where to go in the spaceship they had built. In his speech to the Nobel Committee in 1950, Faulkner spoke of the nuclear age, of the general and universal physical fear it had engendered, a fear of destruction that had become almost unbearable. But, he said:\\n\"I decline to accept the end of a man. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal ... because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.\"\\nFaulkner spoke of the old verities and truths of the heart, of the courage, honor, pride, compassion, pity, sacrifice and, yes, that hope which is the glory of our past. And all of these things we find today in our present; we must use them to build our future. It is why today we can lift up our spirits and our hearts; it is why we resolve that with God\\'s help the cause of humanity will not merely endure but prevail; that some day all the world - every nation, every people, every person - will know the blessings of peace and see the light of freedom.\\n\\n'"

The United\\nNations is actively mediating crises before they explode\\ninto war, all around the world.

On every continent\\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\\nNations.\\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\\ndetermined to do that.\\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\\nStates to acquire such weapons.\\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of\\nperson.\\u201d\\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\\nto building bridges between nations \\u2014 people very much\\nlike all of those present \\u2014 died in a campaign of hatred\\nagainst the United States.\\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\\nelsewhere.\\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\\nto pull back from the world\\u2019s trouble spots, to turn our\\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\\na victory they must never have.\\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\\nmore injured \\u2014 innocent people going about their business\\non a busy morning.\\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\\nalike \\u2014 mostly children and women, two of them\\npregnant \\u2014 people out shopping together when their\\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\\npast.\\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\\nAires.\\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\\nPresident to assassination.\\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\\nNone of those victims were American. But every\\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\\nmother \\u2014 a human life extinguished by someone else\\u2019s\\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\\nbe the same.\\nTerror has become the world\\u2019s problem. Some argue,\\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\\nthreat to all humankind.\\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\\n10\\n\\n\\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\\nEast, in Asia, in South America \\u2014 how many agreements\\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\\nlost in their aftermath.\\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\\nafter all, a leap of faith \\u2014 a break with the past \\u2014 and\\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\\nis not a social programme.\\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\\nbetween the world\\u2019s haves and have-nots. We must work\\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\\nthe poison of hatred.\\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world\\u2019s\\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\\nwithin them.\\nSome believe that terrorism\\u2019s principal fault line\\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\\nhave \\u2014 even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\\nof Islam.\\nA quarter of the world\\u2019s population is Muslim, from\\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\\n11\\n\\n\\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: \\u201cRewards for\\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\\nprayers said at home.\\u201d\\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\\nshould be at the top of the world\\u2019s agenda, what, then, are\\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\\ndespair.\\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\\nNations Children\\u2019s Fund, the World Bank and the World\\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\\ncommunity.\\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\\nthat we do this together.\\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\\njust beginning,\\n\\u201cAll agreements and all peace are built on\\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\\nget on with other people in the world unless you\\nhave confidence in them.\\u201d\\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world\\u2019s\\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\\nnecessary that we agree on all the world\\u2019s issues to have\\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\\nwith confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"53\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1998\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Let me begin by thanking the Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by noting that, at the opening of this fifty third session of the General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.

              "'\\ufeffI would like to begin today by telling the Assembly about an American named Chris Stevens. Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Morocco, and he came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East. He would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked, tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic, listening with a broad smile. Chris went to Benghazi, arriving on a cargo ship, in the early days of the Libyan revolution. As America’s representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded and crafted a vision for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy as Libyans held elections and built new institutions and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship. Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that he met. Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That is when America’s compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city that he had helped to save. He was 52 years old. I tell this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but he also stood up for a set of principles, a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny and live with liberty, dignity, justice and opportunity. The attacks on the American civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan Government and from the Libyan people. There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. I also appreciate that, in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region including Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities and called for calm. So have religious authorities around the globe. But it should be understood that the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America.  They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war, and that, in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens. If we are serious about upholding those ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy or to put out statements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis, because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes we hold in common. Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that such violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations. It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change. We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspirations of the men and women who took to the streets. We supported change in Egypt, because our support for democracy ultimately put us on the side of the people. We welcomed a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer being served by a corrupt status quo. We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition and with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant. And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar Al Assad must come to an end, so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can begin. We have taken those positions because we believe that freedom and self determination are not unique to one culture. Those values are not simply American values or Western values they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that, ultimately, Government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity and individual opportunity that serve as the basis for peace in our world. So, let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive and fair. That democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament, and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity and the right to determine their future. And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said, “To be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others”. True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe and that businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear and on the rule of law and due process, which guarantee the rights of all people. In other words, true democracy real freedom is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform. Moreover, there will always be those who reject human progress dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo, and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we have witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order. At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of race or tribe, and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others. That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. Now, I have made it clear that the United States Government had nothing to do with that video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity. It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well, for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faith. We are home to Muslims, who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion, we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offence at that video, because millions of our citizens are among those people. I know there are some who ask why we do not just ban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in our laws; our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech. Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offence. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. As President of our country and Commander in Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so. Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views, even views that we profoundly disagree with. We do not do so because we support hateful speech, but because our founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of individuals to express their own views and practise their own faith may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities. We do so because, given the power of faith in our lives and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.  I know that not all countries in this body share that particular understanding of the protection of free speech. We recognize that. But in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the f low of information is obsolete. The question then is how do we respond? And on this we must agree: there is no speech that justifies mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There is no video that justifies an attack on an embassy. There is no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan. In our modern world with modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to hateful speech empowers any individual who engages in such speech to create chaos around the world. We empower the worst of us if that is how we respond. More broadly, the events of the past two weeks also speak to the need for all of us to honestly address the tensions between the West and the Arab world, which is moving towards democracy. Now, let me be clear: just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not and will not seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue, nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or the hateful speech of some individuals represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any more than the views of the people who produced that video represent those of Americans. However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism. It is time to marginalize those who, even when not directly resorting to violence, use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central organizing principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes provides an excuse, for those who do resort to violence. That brand of politics, one that pits East against West, and South against North, Muslims against Christians and Hindus and Jews, cannot deliver on the promise of freedom. To young people, it offers only false hope. Burning an American f lag does nothing to provide a child with an education. Smashing apart a restaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an embassy will not create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together, namely, to educate our children and create the opportunities that they deserve; protect human rights and extend democracy’s promise. It should be understood that America will never retreat from the world. We will bring to justice those who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies. We are willing to partner with countries around the world to deepen ties of trade and investment, science and technology, energy and development all efforts that can spark economic growth for all our peoples and stabilize democratic change. But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No Government or company, no school or non governmental organization will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnerships to be effective, our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed. A politics based only on anger one based on dividing the world between us and them not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to those forces. Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day that our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana’a; several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul. The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses towards extremism are used to justify war between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim majority countries than a decade of violence. And extremists understand this. Because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They do not build; they only destroy. It is time to leave the call to violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future or the prisons of the past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future. The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt; it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, “Muslims, Christians, we are one.” The future must not belong to those who bully women; it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons. The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country’s resources; it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support. The future must not belong to those who slander the Prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied. Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shia pilgrims. It is time to heed the words of Gandhi: “Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit”. Together we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, not defined by them. That is what America embodies; that is the vision that we will support. Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on the prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard, but the destination is clear: a secure, Jewish State of Israel and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey. In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. We must remain engaged to ensure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence. Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision: a Syria that is united and inclusive, where children do not need to fear their own Government and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed, Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians. That is what America stands for. That is the outcome that we will work for, with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute, and assistance and support for those who work for this common good, because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and the legitimacy to lead. In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbours. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian Government continues to prop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear programme is peaceful and to meet its obligations to the United Nations. So let me be clear. America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. Make no mistake: a nuclear armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear arms race in the region and the unravelling of the Treaty on the Non proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. That is why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian Government accountable, and that is why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That is why this institution was established, from the rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the cold war, and that is the lesson of the last two decades as well. History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices. Nations in every part of the world have travelled this difficult path. Europe, the bloodiest battlefield of the twentieth century, is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations. It is because of the progress that I have witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I have witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We have begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaida has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made, from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan, to put more power in the hands of citizens. At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the Group of 20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and has worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. Later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking. All those things give me hope. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions taken by us, not the actions of leaders; it is the people that I have seen the American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away, the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind, the faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations, the young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. Those men, women, and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity. So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That is what we see on the news. That is what consumes our political debates. But when you strip it all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice that exists when Governments serve their people and not the other way around. The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for people all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. That is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life. I promise you this: long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens’s legacy will live on in the lives that he touched, in the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs that read simply, “Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans”. They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it justice will be done, that history is on our side and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed.  '"

On every continent\\npeople are leading lives of integrity and self-respect, and\\na great deal of the credit for that belongs to the United\\nNations.\\nStill, as every person in this Hall knows, the promise\\nof our time is attended by perils. Global economic turmoil\\ntoday threatens to undermine confidence in free markets\\nand democracy. Those of us who benefit particularly from\\nthis economy have a special responsibility to do more to\\nminimize the turmoil and extend the benefits of global\\nmarkets to all citizens. And the United States is\\ndetermined to do that.\\nWe still are bedevilled by ethnic, racial, religious\\nand tribal hatreds, by the spread of weapons of mass\\ndestruction, by the almost frantic efforts of too many\\nStates to acquire such weapons.\\nAnd, despite all efforts to contain it, terrorism is not\\nfading away with the end of the twentieth century. It is a\\ncontinuing defiance of article 3 of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, which says\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\u201cEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of\\nperson.\\u201d\\nHere at the United Nations, at international summits\\naround the world and on many occasions in the United\\nStates, I have had the opportunity to address this subject in\\ndetail, to describe what we have done, what we are doing\\nand what we must yet do to combat terror.\\nToday I would like to talk to the Assembly about why\\nall nations must put the fight against terrorism at the top of\\nour agenda. Obviously this is a matter of profound concern\\nto us. In the last 15 years our citizens have been targeted\\nover and over again: in Beirut; over Lockerbie; in Saudi\\nArabia; at home in Oklahoma City by one of our own\\ncitizens; even here in New York, in one of our most public\\nbuildings; and most recently, on 7 August, in Nairobi and\\nDar-es-Salaam, where Americans who devoted their lives\\nto building bridges between nations \\u2014 people very much\\nlike all of those present \\u2014 died in a campaign of hatred\\nagainst the United States.\\nBecause we are blessed to be a wealthy nation, with\\na powerful military and a worldwide presence active in\\npromoting peace and security, we are often a target. We\\nlove our country for its dedication to political and religious\\nfreedom, to economic opportunity, to respect for the rights\\nof the individual. But we know that many people see us as\\na symbol of a system and values they reject. And often they\\nfind it expedient to blame us for problems with deep roots\\nelsewhere.\\nBut we are no threat to any peaceful nation, and we\\nbelieve the best way to disprove these claims is to continue\\nour work for peace and prosperity around the world. For us\\nto pull back from the world\\u2019s trouble spots, to turn our\\nbacks on those taking risks for peace, to weaken our own\\nopposition to terrorism, would hand the enemies of peace\\na victory they must never have.\\nStill, it is a grave misconception to see terrorism as\\nonly, or even mostly, an American problem. Indeed, it is a\\nclear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and\\ninnocent people everywhere. No one in this room, nor the\\npeople represented here, is immune. Certainly not the\\npeople of Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. For every American\\nkilled there, roughly 20 Africans were murdered and 500\\nmore injured \\u2014 innocent people going about their business\\non a busy morning.\\nNot the people of Omagh, in Northern Ireland, where\\nthe wounded and killed were Catholics and Protestants\\nalike \\u2014 mostly children and women, two of them\\npregnant \\u2014 people out shopping together when their\\nfuture was snuffed out by a fringe group clinging to the\\npast.\\nNot the people of Japan, who were poisoned by sarin\\ngas in the Tokyo subway.\\nNot the people of Argentina, who died when a car\\nbomb destroyed a Jewish community centre in Buenos\\nAires.\\nNot the people of Kashmir and Sri Lanka, killed by\\nancient animosities that cry out for resolution.\\nNot the Palestinians and Israelis, who still die year\\nafter year, for all their progress towards peace.\\nNot the people of Algeria, enduring a nightmare of\\nunfathomable terror with still no end in sight.\\nNot the people of Egypt, who nearly lost a second\\nPresident to assassination.\\nNot the people of Turkey, Colombia, Albania,\\nRussia, Iran, Indonesia and countless other nations where\\ninnocent people have been victimized by terror.\\nNone of those victims were American. But every\\none was a son or daughter, a husband or wife, a father or\\nmother \\u2014 a human life extinguished by someone else\\u2019s\\nhatred, leaving a circle of people whose lives will never\\nbe the same.\\nTerror has become the world\\u2019s problem. Some argue,\\nof course, that the problem is overblown, saying that the\\nnumber of deaths from terrorism is comparatively small,\\nsometimes less than the number of people killed by\\nlightning in a single year. I believe that misses the point\\nin several ways. First, terrorism has a new face in the\\n1990s. Today, terrorists take advantage of greater\\nopenness and the explosion of information and weapons\\ntechnology. The new technologies of terror and their\\nincreasing availability, along with the increasing mobility\\nof terrorists, raise chilling prospects of vulnerability to\\nchemical, biological and other kinds of attacks, bringing\\neach of us into the category of possible victim. This is a\\nthreat to all humankind.\\nBeyond the physical damage of each attack, there is\\nan even greater residue of psychological damage, hard to\\nmeasure but slow to heal. Every bomb, every bomb\\n10\\n\\n\\nthreat, has an insidious effect on free and open institutions;\\nthe kinds of institutions everyone in this body is working so\\nhard to build. Each time an innocent man or woman or\\nchild is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the\\nrest of us, for each violent act saps the confidence that is so\\ncrucial to peace and prosperity.\\nIn every corner of the world, with the active support\\nof United Nations agencies, people are struggling to build\\nbetter futures based on bonds of trust connecting them with\\ntheir fellow citizens and with partners and investors from\\naround the world. The glimpse of growing prosperity in\\nNorthern Ireland was a crucial factor in the Good Friday\\nAgreement. But that took confidence, confidence that\\ncannot be bought in times of violence. We can measure\\neach attack in the grisly statistics of dead and wounded. But\\nwhat are the wounds we cannot measure? In the Middle\\nEast, in Asia, in South America \\u2014 how many agreements\\nhave been thwarted after bombs blew up? How many\\nbusinesses will never be created in places crying out for\\ninvestments of time and money? How many talented young\\npeople in countries represented here have turned their backs\\non public service? The question is not only how many lives\\nhave been lost in each attack, but how many futures were\\nlost in their aftermath.\\nThere is no justification for killing innocents.\\nIdeology, religion and politics, even deprivation and\\nrighteous grievance, do not justify it. We must seek to\\nunderstand the roiled waters in which terror occurs. Of\\ncourse we must. Often in my own experience I have seen\\nthat where peace is making progress, terror is a desperate\\nact to turn back the tide of history. The Omagh bombing\\ncame as peace was succeeding in Northern Ireland. In the\\nMiddle East, whenever we get close to another step towards\\npeace, its enemies respond with terror. We must not let this\\nstall our momentum. The bridging of ancient hatreds is,\\nafter all, a leap of faith \\u2014 a break with the past \\u2014 and\\nthus a frightening threat to those who cannot let go of their\\nown hatred. Because they fear the future, in these cases\\nterrorists seek to blow the peacemakers back into the past.\\nWe must also acknowledge that there are economic\\nsources of this rage as well. Poverty, inequality and masses\\nof disenfranchised young people are fertile fields for the\\nsiren call of the terrorists and their claims of advancing\\nsocial justice. But deprivation cannot justify destruction; nor\\ncan inequity ever atone for murder. The killing of innocents\\nis not a social programme.\\nNevertheless, our resolute opposition to terrorism does\\nnot mean we can ever be indifferent to the conditions that\\nfoster it. The most recent United Nations Human\\nDevelopment Report suggests the gulf is widening\\nbetween the world\\u2019s haves and have-nots. We must work\\nharder to treat the sources of despair before they turn into\\nthe poison of hatred.\\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once wrote that the only\\nrevolutionary is a man who has nothing to lose. We must\\nshow people they have everything to gain by embracing\\ncooperation and renouncing violence. This is not simply\\nan American or a Western responsibility; it is the world\\u2019s\\nresponsibility. Developing nations have an obligation to\\nspread new wealth fairly, to create new opportunities, to\\nbuild new, open economies. Developed nations have an\\nobligation to help developing nations stay on the path of\\nprosperity and to spur global economic growth. A week\\nago I outlined ways we can build a stronger international\\neconomy to benefit not only all nations, but all citizens\\nwithin them.\\nSome believe that terrorism\\u2019s principal fault line\\ncentres on what they see as an inevitable clash of\\ncivilizations. This is an issue that deserves a lot of debate\\nin this great Hall. Specifically, many believe there is an\\ninevitable clash between Western civilization and values\\nand Islamic civilization and values. I believe this view is\\nterribly wrong. False prophets may use and abuse any\\nreligion to justify whatever political objectives they\\nhave \\u2014 even cold-blooded murder. Some may have the\\nworld believe that Almighty God Himself, the merciful,\\ngrants a licence to kill; but that is not our understanding\\nof Islam.\\nA quarter of the world\\u2019s population is Muslim, from\\nAfrica to the Middle East to Asia and to the United\\nStates, where Islam is one of our fastest growing faiths.\\nThere are over 1,200 mosques and Islamic centres in the\\nUnited States, and that number is rapidly increasing. The\\n6 million Americans who worship there will tell you there\\nis no inherent clash between Islam and America.\\nAmericans respect and honour Islam.\\nAs I talk to Muslim leaders in my country and\\naround the world, I see again that we share the same\\nhopes and aspirations: to live in peace and security, to\\nprovide for our children, to follow the faith of our\\nchoosing, to build a better life than our parents knew and\\nto pass on brighter possibilities to our children.\\nOf course, we are not identical. There are important\\ndifferences that cross race and culture and religion which\\ndemand understanding and deserve respect. But every\\n11\\n\\n\\nriver has a crossing place. Even as we struggle here in\\nAmerica, like the United Nations, to reconcile all\\nAmericans to each other and to find greater unity in our\\nincreasing diversity, we will remain on a course of\\nfriendship with and respect for the Muslim world. We will\\ncontinue to look for common values, common interests and\\ncommon endeavours. I agree very much with the spirit\\nexpressed by these words of Mohammed: \\u201cRewards for\\nprayers by people assembled together are twice those for\\nprayers said at home.\\u201d\\nWhen it comes to terrorism, there should be no\\ndividing line between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and\\nCatholics, Serbs and Albanians, developed societies and\\nemerging countries. The only dividing line is between those\\nwho practise, support or tolerate terror and those who\\nunderstand that it is murder, plain and simple.\\nIf terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and\\nshould be at the top of the world\\u2019s agenda, what, then, are\\nthe concrete steps we can take together to protect our\\ncommon destiny? What are our common obligations? At\\nleast, I believe, they are these: to give terrorists no support,\\nno sanctuary, no financial assistance; to bring pressure on\\nStates that do; to act together to step up extradition and\\nprosecution; to sign the global anti-terror conventions; to\\nstrengthen the Biological Weapons Convention and enforce\\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention; to promote stronger\\ndomestic laws and control the manufacture and export of\\nexplosives; to raise international standards for airport\\nsecurity; to combat the conditions that spread violence and\\ndespair.\\nWe are working to do our part. Our intelligence and\\nlaw enforcement communities are tracking terrorist\\nnetworks in cooperation with other Governments. Some of\\nthose we believe responsible for the recent bombing of our\\nembassies have been brought to justice. Early this week I\\nwill ask our Congress to provide emergency funding to\\nrepair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the\\nworldwide fight against terrorism and to help our friends in\\nKenya and Tanzania with the wounds they have suffered.\\nBut no matter how much each of us does alone, our\\nprogress will be limited without our common efforts.\\nWe will also do our part to address the sources of\\ndespair and alienation through the Agency for International\\nDevelopment in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America, in\\nEastern Europe, in Haiti and elsewhere. We will continue\\nour strong support for the United Nations Development\\nProgramme, the Office of the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the Office of United\\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United\\nNations Children\\u2019s Fund, the World Bank and the World\\nFood Programme. We also recognize the critical role\\nthese agencies play and the importance of all countries,\\nincluding the United States, in paying their fair share.\\nIn closing, let me urge all of us to think in new\\nterms on terrorism, to see it not as a clash of cultures, or\\npolitical action by other means, or a divine calling, but as\\na clash between the forces of the past and the forces of\\nthe future, between those who tear down and those who\\nbuild up, between hope and fear, between chaos and\\ncommunity.\\nThe fight will not be easy. But every nation will be\\nstrengthened in joining it, in working to give real meaning\\nto the words of the Universal Declaration of Human\\nRights we signed 50 years ago. It is very, very important\\nthat we do this together.\\nEleanor Roosevelt was one of the authors of the\\nUniversal Declaration. She said, in one of her many\\nspeeches in support of the United Nations when it was\\njust beginning,\\n\\u201cAll agreements and all peace are built on\\nconfidence. You cannot have peace and you cannot\\nget on with other people in the world unless you\\nhave confidence in them.\\u201d\\nIt is not necessary that we solve all the world\\u2019s\\nproblems to have confidence in one another. It is not\\nnecessary that we agree on all the world\\u2019s issues to have\\nconfidence in one another. It is not even necessary that\\nwe understand every single difference among us to have\\nconfidence in one another. But it is necessary that we\\naffirm our belief in the primacy of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, and therefore that together\\nwe say that terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a\\nthrowback to yesterday, and together, together we can\\nmeet it and overcome its threats, its injuries and its fears\\nwith confidence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Session\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"53\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"1998\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Speech_clean\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 49,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Let me begin by thanking the Assembly for its very kind and generous welcome and by noting that, at the opening of this fifty third session of the General Assembly, the world has much to celebrate.

              " ' As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya',\n",
              " ' He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked, tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic, listening with a broad smile',\n",
              " ' Chris went to Benghazi, arriving on a cargo ship, in the early days of the Libyan revolution',\n",
              " ' As America’s representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded and crafted a vision for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected',\n",
              " ' After the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy as Libyans held elections and built new institutions and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship',\n",
              " ' Chris Stevens loved his work',\n",
              " ' He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that he met',\n",
              " ' Two weeks ago, he travelled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital',\n",
              " ' That is when America’s compound came under attack',\n",

              " ' So have religious authorities around the globe',\n",
              " ' But it should be understood that the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America',\n",
              " '  They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war, and that, in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens',\n",
              " ' If we are serious about upholding those ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an Embassy or to put out statements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass',\n",
              " ' If we are serious about those ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis, because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes we hold in common',\n",
              " ' Today, we must affirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens, and not by his killers',\n",

              " ' It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring',\n",
              " ' Since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that has taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change',\n",

              " ' We welcomed a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer being served by a corrupt status quo',\n",
              " ' We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition and with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant',\n",
              " ' And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar Al Assad must come to an end, so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can begin',\n",
              " ' We have taken those positions because we believe that freedom and self determination are not unique to one culture',\n",
              " ' Those values are not simply American values or Western values they are universal values',\n",
              " ' And even as there will be huge challenges that come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that, ultimately, Government of the people, by the people and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity and individual opportunity that serve as the basis for peace in our world',\n",
              " ' So, let us remember that this is a season of progress',\n",

              " ' Over the past year, we have seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal and a new President in Somalia',\n",
              " ' In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to Parliament, and people look forward to further reform',\n",
              " ' Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity and the right to determine their future',\n",
              " ' And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot',\n",
              " ' Nelson Mandela once said, “To be free is not merely to cast off one’s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others”',\n",
              " ' True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe and that businesses can be opened without paying a bribe',\n",
              " ' It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear and on the rule of law and due process, which guarantee the rights of all people',\n",

              " ' In hard economic times, countries may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform',\n",
              " ' Moreover, there will always be those who reject human progress dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend upon the status quo, and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division',\n",
              " ' From Northern Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we have witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order',\n",
              " ' At times, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of race or tribe, and often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world',\n",
              " ' In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they are willing to tolerate freedom for others',\n",
              " ' That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world',\n",
              " ' Now, I have made it clear that the United States Government had nothing to do with that video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity',\n",
              " ' It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well, for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faith',\n",
              " ' We are home to Muslims, who worship across our country',\n",

              " ' I know there are some who ask why we do not just ban such a video',\n",

              " ' As President of our country and Commander in Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and I will always defend their right to do so',\n",
              " ' Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views, even views that we profoundly disagree with',\n",
              " ' We do not do so because we support hateful speech, but because our founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of individuals to express their own views and practise their own faith may be threatened',\n",
              " ' We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities',\n",
              " ' We do so because, given the power of faith in our lives and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect',\n",
              " '  I know that not all countries in this body share that particular understanding of the protection of free speech',\n",
              " ' We recognize that',\n",
              " ' But in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the f low of information is obsolete',\n",

              " ' In our modern world with modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to hateful speech empowers any individual who engages in such speech to create chaos around the world',\n",
              " ' We empower the worst of us if that is how we respond',\n",
              " ' More broadly, the events of the past two weeks also speak to the need for all of us to honestly address the tensions between the West and the Arab world, which is moving towards democracy',\n",
              " ' Now, let me be clear: just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not and will not seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad',\n",
              " ' We do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue, nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or the hateful speech of some individuals represents the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any more than the views of the people who produced that video represent those of Americans',\n",
              " ' However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism',\n",
              " ' It is time to marginalize those who, even when not directly resorting to violence, use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central organizing principle of politics',\n",
              " ' For that only gives cover, and sometimes provides an excuse, for those who do resort to violence',\n",
              " ' That brand of politics, one that pits East against West, and South against North, Muslims against Christians and Hindus and Jews, cannot deliver on the promise of freedom',\n",

              " ' Attacking an embassy will not create a single job',\n",
              " ' That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together, namely, to educate our children and create the opportunities that they deserve; protect human rights and extend democracy’s promise',\n",
              " ' It should be understood that America will never retreat from the world',\n",
              " ' We will bring to justice those who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies',\n",
              " ' We are willing to partner with countries around the world to deepen ties of trade and investment, science and technology, energy and development all efforts that can spark economic growth for all our peoples and stabilize democratic change',\n",
              " ' But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect',\n",

              " ' On the same day that our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana’a; several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul',\n",
              " ' The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained',\n",
              " ' The same impulses towards extremism are used to justify war between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans',\n",
              " ' It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos',\n",
              " ' In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim majority countries than a decade of violence',\n",
